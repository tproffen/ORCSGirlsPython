Rather than hard coding this for apples and oranges, we will use machine learning to classify any fruit (or other items) based on training data which include the correct label. In our case we have a long list of weights and surface smoothness values labelled with the correct fruit. From this data set, the computer will learn and be able to classify objects it learned about.\n",
